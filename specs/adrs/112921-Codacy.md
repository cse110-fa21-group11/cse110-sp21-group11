# Decision- Use Codacy as a Tool for Code Quality Check
## Context and Problem Statement: We want an automated code review tool that is easy to set up and supports a variety of langauges and frameworks we use for our project. Which code quality tool works the best with our project's needs?
## Considered Options  
*  [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) - An automated code review tool that performs continuos static analysis for multiple languages and frameworks including  Java, JSON, Markdown, JavaScript, and CSS. 
 *  [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) - A code review tool that auto-syncs with Github after each git push to analyze code for complexity, duplication, etc. 
## Decision Outcome: Chosen option: "Codacy", because 
* Code Climate performs static analysis comparable to ESLint and less security issue checking than Codacy.
* Codacy uses a single integration and works together with other tools.
* Codacy is easier to setup and see instant results from linking to repo. 
* Codacy's UI is more intuitive and we can easily change configuration using a pattern list/imported configuration file.
* Codacy dashboard displays more clearly of code duplication, code complexity, and test coverage, as well as cloud infrastructure static analysis to enforce security.
