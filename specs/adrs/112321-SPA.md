# Decision- Use a Single-Page Application to display data
## Context and Problem Statement: We need to decide whether to have multiple web pages for different purposes or to have everything be part of a single page where the contents are changed dynamically
## Considered Options  
*  [Single-Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) - A method of dynamically rewriting the data of a web page as opposed to having a multitude of individual web pages
 *  Multiple Pages - Using multiple HTML files to represent multiple web pages
## Decision Outcome: Chosen option: "SPA", because 
* Our users will likely be frequently navigating to different sub-pages such as for different categories or to search for results
* The latency of repeatedly querying the API already presents an obstacle on page load.
* Using an SPA will allow us to make queries behind the scenes such that certain pages would have their recipe data fully loaded before the user even clicks to navigate, hiding some of the aformentioned API lag.
* Transitions will likely be made faster even between pages that don't necessarily necessitate API queries on-load.
* SPA functionality will be needed regardless to display dynamic data such as search results and for the expanded recipe pages.
