# Decision- Use Netlify as a host
## Context and Problem Statement: We want a host for our web app that best matches our project's needs. Which host would be best?
## Considered Options  
*  [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - A hosting service optimized for web apps and static websites
 *  [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com//) - A cloud PaaS 
 *  [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) - Another hosting service more optimized for dynamic content 
## Decision Outcome: Chosen option: "Netlify", because 
* Other teams report having trouble with other hosts such as Firebase or Heroku.
* Netlify was labelled a "tier-2" option by the professor and thus was recommended over several other options.
* Netlify has been referred to as better-serving more static sites; our site isn't dependent on user time/location/device for functionality and thus Netlify caters more to our purposes.
* The app will hypothetically run faster as it uses global distribution and pre-rendering.
