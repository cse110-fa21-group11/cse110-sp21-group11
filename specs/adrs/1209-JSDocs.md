# Decision- Use JSDocs as a Tool for Project API Documentation
## Context and Problem Statement: We want a documentation tool that is easy to set up and supports javascript. Which API documentation tool works the best with our project's needs?
## Considered Options  
*  [JSDocs](https://www.codacy.com/) - a Javascript documentation tool that allows us to comment directly to our project source code right along our code itself. 
## Decision Outcome: Chosen option: "JSDocs", because 
* JSDoc can scan our source code and generate an HTML documentation website for our project need.
* Supports Javascript specifically.
* Allows us to add tags and information along with tags for methods and headers.
* We can simply run jsdoc as a command to generate documentation.
