## **Our Branding** ##

![Hell's Kitchen Photo](/admin/branding/he11skitchen.png)

As team 11, we wanted to incorporate our number into something that we all enjoy. We thought of Hell's Kitchen; Gordon Ramsay cracks down on aspiring chefs and aggressively teaches them sets of valuable skills that would serve to be useful to them throughout their careers. Now we are He11's Kitchen!

Instead of our tools consisting of various cooking equipment, we will instead be armed with our git repository, computers, knowledge, programs, team work, and communication skills. Cooking consists of preparing food through various different techniques and combining different foods and spices with a variety of kitchen tools depending on the dish, environment, and constraints. Software engineering is pretty similiar - He11's Kitchen's aim is to cook up tasty dishes, but unlike the chefs in Hell's Kitchen, we will all be working together cohesively as a team to come up with spectaular results rather than explicitly individually working in our stations.  

## **Values** ##
- Communication is key!
- Team contribution from everyone, but make sure that not all the work falls onto one person or a few select team members. Remember, bus factor shouldn't be low.
- Don't feel afraid to ask for help
- Psychological safety: Mistakes are normal. If a team member makes a mistake, don't attack them for it. Reassure them that it's okay and ask for help.

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at UCSD majoring in applied mathematics and computer science. My professional and academic interests include software engineering and web development. I went to a charter fine arts school in high school called the Orange County School of the Arts where I was accepted into the visual arts conservatory, so my biggest hobby is art. I love to experiment with all types of mediums including digital media, watercolor, oil painting, and plein-air painting to name a few, but my absolute favorite is oil painting since it is the most forgiving! Otherwise, I love baking, reading, trying out different workouts, and cats.

In my free time, I like to play game and watch movies, I also love cats. I have two cats, Their name are 15 and 1.

I am a 25-year-old student working on my bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science. My professional interests are in cryptography and machine learning, though I am a novice in both. These fields seem incredibly relevant in this day and age, and I don't see them losing their relevance any time soon. As for personal interests, I enjoy cooking, painting, drawing, and skateboarding. I think cooking and painting go hand in hand, in a way, because they are both a form of art that requires a lot of practice to master. I'm no expert at either, but I enjoy learning and improving my skills.
