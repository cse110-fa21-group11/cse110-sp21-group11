I am a fourth year undergraduate student at UCSD majoring in applied mathematics and computer science. I am also interested in web development as stated here. I went to a charter fine arts school in high school called the Orange County School of the Arts where I was accepted into the visual arts conservatory, so my biggest hobby is art. I love to experiment with all types of mediums including digital media, watercolor, oil painting, and plein-air painting to name a few, but my absolute favorite is oil painting since it is the most forgiving.
