## Meeting Events and Highlights (Greater detail and results of Retrium meeting in repo):
- Used retrium's spoke system to analyze what the team thinks about the progress of each team(design, backend, testing) as well as overall progress and mood. The results came in at around a 4 average for each spoke that mentioned progress, and lower at around a 2.9 for overall mood(due to stress about other classes and workload, time constraints, and finals approaching)
- Used "sad/mad/glad" function to analyze what people are concerned/happy about in terms of our progress 
- Voted on sad/mad/glad comments to showcase the most important issues that were brought up - mainly included concerns about time and finals but we also saw satisfaciton with how everything is coming together
- Created action plans to resolve all issues brought up - included things like commenting more thoroughly to help out testing team  
- Created goals and a to-do list for each team(design, backend, testing):
   - Design needs to work on nav bar permanent scrolling, responsiveness, and uploading star images for ratings
   - Backend has to imeplement the recipe expand pages as well as the CRUD implementation for user-uploaded recipes and linking that with the design team's html files for both the recipe expand page and the CRUd page(for uploading a recipe).
