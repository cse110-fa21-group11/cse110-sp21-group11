## Meeting Events and Highlights (Greater detail and results of Retrium meeting in repo):
- Used retrium's spoke rating system to gague team's thoughts about several metrics of our progress and of our group dynamic; results were almost exactly average for each metric with a fairly wide-ranging distribution
- Used "sad/mad/glad" function to gauge where everyone's at individually and to see what people are concerned or anxious about both project-wise and team-wise
- Voted on individual-generated comments to see where our biggest issues lie- mostly to do with direction and clarity of where to go next.
- Created specific action plans to resolve all issues brought up
- Talked about how to resolve these issues in both the short and long-term
- Immediately started setting up short-term goals and deadlines for specific features that were holding other teams' progress back
- Reiterated the importance of communication and defining clear goals and also being clear about what one can and can't accomplish individually to reduce information hoarding
- Expressed the importance of cross-subteam communication so that teams don't accidentally divert courses from each other without realizing
