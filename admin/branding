As team 11, we wanted to incorporate our number into something that we all enjoy. We thought of Hell's Kitchen; Gordon Ramsay cracks down on aspiring chefs and aggressively teaches them sets of valuable skills that would serve to be useful to them throughout their careers. Now we are He11's Kitchen!

Instead of our tools consisting of various cooking equipment, we will instead be armed with our git repository, computers, knowledge, programs, team work, and communication skills. Cooking consists of preparing food through various different techniques and combining different foods and spices with a variety of kitchen tools depending on the dish, environment, and constraints. Software engineering is pretty similiar - He11's Kitchen's aim is to cook up tasty dishes, but unlike the chefs in Hell's Kitchen, we will all be working together cohesively as a team to come up with spectaular results rather than explicitly individually working in our stations.
